Synapse is a central hub that supports an array of connected devices designed for the efficient monitoring and management of clinical practices in hospitals. Synapse enable the wards to be smart in its operation through timely updates and data from a plethora of connected devices. Dripo is an infusion monitor which is connected to synapse. The handy device displays the real-time rate of infusion when clamped to the drip chamber. The flow rate controller helps to set the drop rate precisely. The device alerts rate changes and completion of the course at the nursing station via a device hub installed there. It can effectively manage the entire infusion course of a hospital, nursing home or home healthcare services. Unlike other rate monitors, Dripo addresses almost all the functional issues in IV therapy. Cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness and better patient experience are its key advantages.',\n",
